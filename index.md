## About Me

I am currently in my fourth year as a Ph.D. student in Artificial Intelligence and Music (AIM) program, at the C4DM, QMUL, supervised by [Prof. George Fazekas](https://www.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/~gyorgyf/about.html) and [Prof. Geraint Wiggins](https://ai.vub.ac.be/team/geraint-wiggins/). My research is centered around applying deep learning techniques to generate controllable, expressive piano performances, with a specific emphasis on creating pianist-style conditioned outputs. My academic interests span a range of topics, including controllable music generation, modeling of expressive performances, classification of performers, analysis of music performances, and related areas.

## Education

- **[Sep. 2020 - Now]** Ph.D. Student in Artificial Intelligence and Music (AIM) program, at Queen Mary University of London
- **[Sep. 2016 - May 2020]** Bachelor of Science in Statistics (Data Science Branch), at Chinese Univeristy of Hong Kong, Shenzhen

## Research Interests

- **Automated Music Generation:** controllable music generation, music style transfer, expressive performance rendering, music genration evaluation
- **Music Information Retrieval:** music performer/composer/style classification, music performance analysis, music transcription, music alignment algorithms
- **Machine Learning:** deep generative models, contrastive learning, few-shot learning, transfer learning

## News
- **[Feb. 2024]** I started my research internship under supervision of [Prof. Yamagishi Junichi](https://researchmap.jp/read0205283) at National Institute of Informatics.
- **[Nov. 2023]** Our papers about reconstructing human expressiveness in piano performances and a dataset of jazz variations for jazz standards were presented in the oral sessions at CMMR 2023, Japan.
- **[Oct. 2023]** Our paper about a pianist identification system was presented in the poster session at IS2 2023, Italy.
- **[Dec. 2022]** We released a large-scale dataset of the automatic transcribed expressive piano performances in ISMIR 2022, India.
